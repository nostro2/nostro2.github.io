  Hello! My name is Dan and I'm an AWS Certified DevOps Professional that loves all things automation. I have experience building and supporting customer projects on a wide range of services offered by Amazon Web Services. Some of my favourite services include: `CloudFormation`, `EC2` and `CodePipeline`. As well as keeping the the lights on, I like to get my hands dirty developing AWS `Lambda` functions and trying new technologies out.

  I'm currently working at KCOM as a DevOps Engineer, supporting new and existing AWS based projects using an infrastructure as code approach.

  Skills:
  `AWS` `Bash` `Python` `Linux` `CI/CD` `IaC` `Git` `Network Engineering` `Cloud Security`
